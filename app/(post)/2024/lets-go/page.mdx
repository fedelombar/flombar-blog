One of the main reasons I ventured into building my own startup was to challenge myself. Often, we set limits on what we think we can do, and sometimes we're even too scared to push beyond those boundaries.

Having worked at startups from the ground up, I witnessed firsthand how they raised funds, managed day-to-day operations, and distributed tasks among the team. That experience taught me that while the early days can be incredibly tough, once you hit a few key milestones and fully commit to your vision, things start to fall into place.

As a SWE, I've learned to tackle the diverse challenges that startups face in order to grow and adapt in a competitive market. This journey has also empowered me to create amazing solutions.

After some time, I reached a point where I wanted to try something new, advance my career, and build something that genuinely helps people by solving real problems.

That's why I created Faneandoâ€”a platform that has taught me to move quickly, understand user needs, and build a team of the right people. Faneando was my first hands-on experience in learning how to refine my process, confront challenges head-on, and manage the pressures that come with building something from scratch.
